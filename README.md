# FEUP-MNUM
Implementation of some Numerical Methods in C++ for the MNUM course at FEUP.
Most of these methods were developed during TP classes. Some of the methods have some weired and out of context C++ concepts because I was not confortable with them at the time and took the oportunity to practice them. 
This code was made for educational purposes, so you can use it as you please (including pasting it in the exam! Don't get caugth though...), just keep in mind I'm not responsible for anything.
